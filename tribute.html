                    <h3 class="p-info">the beginning</h3>
                    <p class="luan-life">Luan had a rough start back in Brazil. His parents left him to be raised by his grandparents. When Luan was 9 years old his grandfather gave him a plastic board and he start skating in front of his house. He would practice all day long and his grandparents were very supportive. eventually he started going to a local skate park called IAPI, which was about 50 minutes away from his home. Luan was evolving so fast and a local skate shop, Matriz skateshop, began sponsoring him. Luan started to win lots of contest and getting respect by the brazillian skateboarding comunnity. All the prizes he won on contests he would sell it to help his grandparents. But, unfortunately his grandparents passed away and two years later he decided to live in the USA.</p>

                    <p class="luan-life">Luan arrived in the US in 2007, he won the tampa am 2007 and 2008 back to back. Like in Brazil everybody became addicted to his skating and soon he was very respected. He began to ride for flip, that later in 2010 would turn him pro. and since then he has won two tampa pros (2013/2015), two street leagues (2015/2015) and many others contests. Not to mention, his amazing video parts. Now Luan is consider a legend, skating like a beast and still having fun in his board.</p>
